# TUM Aries Lab 👋

This repository should be used as a central location to store and share software between members of the Aries Lab.

Some packages currently under development are:
1. Quaternion-based Extended Kalman Filter to process IMU data - [link](https://github.com/TUM-Aries-Lab/quaternion-ekf)
2. Example template to start your own Python project - [link](https://github.com/TUM-Aries-Lab/template-python)
3. CircuitPython code to advertise IMU data with Bluetooth Low Energy over UART - [link](https://github.com/TUM-Aries-Lab)
4. Plotly-based visualization tool to view lower limb segment orientation in real time - [link](https://github.com/TUM-Aries-Lab)

## Getting Started
A very helpful repository template to start your own project can be created with the following command. 

`git clone https://github.com/TUM-Aries-Lab/template-python.git`

Please feel free to make merge requests on this template when you see fit.
