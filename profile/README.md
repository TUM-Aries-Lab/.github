# TUM Aries Lab 👋

This repository should be used as a central location to store and share software between members of the Aries Lab.

Some packages currently under development are:
1. Quaternion-based Extended Kalman Filter to process IMU data
2. Example template to start your own Python project
3. CircuitPython code to advertise IMU data over Bluetooth Low Energy with UART on a microcontroller
4. Plotly-based visualization tool to view lower limb segment orientation

## Getting Started
A very helpful repository template to start your own project can be created with the following command. 

`git clone https://github.com/TUM-Aries-Lab/template-python.git`

Please feel free to make merge requests on this template when you see fit.
